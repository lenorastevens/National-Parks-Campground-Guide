# Overview
## Purpose
- My family and I love to travel for weeks at a time. Our favorite ways to spend time in nature is to explore the national parks. They are an endless source of beauty. No park is the same. Each has itâ€™s own story of how it formed and how it came to be protected in the national park system. Visitors to my site will be able to research campground options and amenities to assist in planning and putting together a trip of their own.
## Problem to Solve:
- Using the NP website to plan a camping trip requires a user to know already which park they want to go to before looking at campground options. My project will help with filtering. 

## Why?
- I am hoping to make it easier to pick a campground and make it more likely that people will get out and enjoy nature.

# Audience
- Campers, adventurers, photographers, travelers, and nature enthusiasts, family, friends.
- Anyone interested in visiting a national park that may be willing to camp there as well.

# Major functions of the application
- First, the program will take an input from the user selecting a state.
- This selection will load the possible National Parks in that state with campgrounds. 
- A user will be able to select a park and then have the individual campground options displayed with detailed information on each campground.
