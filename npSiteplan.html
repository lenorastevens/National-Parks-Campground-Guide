        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>My family and I love to travel for weeks at a time. Our favorite ways to spend time in nature is to explore
            the national parks. They are an endless source of beauty. No park is the same. Each has itâ€™s own story of
            how it formed and how it came to be protected in the national park system.
            Visitors to my site will be able to research campground options and amenities to assist in planning and
            putting together a trip of their own. Let's Travel!
